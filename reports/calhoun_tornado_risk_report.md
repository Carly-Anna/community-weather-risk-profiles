## 1. Overview

This report seeks to analyze historical tornado data and social vulberability in Calhoun County, Alabama from the years 2000 - 2023. 

It combines tornado intensity, damage, and injury data with community risk indicators derived from the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (SVI).

## 3. Correlation Analysis

### Correlation Matrix: Intensity, Damage, Injuries
![Correlation Heatmap](outputs/tornado_correlation_heatmap.png)

- **Observations:**
  - Higher intensities are moderately correlated with property damage, as expected.
  - Few injuries recorded; limited correlation patterns may exist. This is likely due to a lower population density observed in Calhoun County, though it could also suggest higher preparedness levels in this localized region, including but not limited to owning storm shelters or having safe rooms / buildings to shelter in.
