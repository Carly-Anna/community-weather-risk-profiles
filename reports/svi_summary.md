# Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Analysis for Alabama Counties

## Introduction

The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a metric developed by the CDC to identify communities that may need support before, during, or after disasters. It combines multiple socioeconomic and demographic factors to assess vulnerability.

## Data Overview

This analysis uses the SVI data for Alabama counties, merged with geographic shapefiles to visualize vulnerability across the state. The focus is on the socioeconomic theme (RPL_THEME1), which includes indicators like poverty, unemployment, and income.

## Key Findings

- The map visualization highlights counties with varying levels of socioeconomic vulnerability.
- Some counties show higher vulnerability, indicated by darker colors on the map.
- For example, Calhoun County has a socioeconomic vulnerability score of 0.4697, which is moderate relative to other counties.

## Limitations

- Some counties may have uniform or limited data variation, which can affect the interpretation.
- The current dataset focuses on one vulnerability theme; further analysis could include other SVI themes.

## Conclusion

Mapping and analyzing SVI data provides valuable insights for emergency planners and public health officials. It helps target resources to communities that need them most and improve disaster preparedness and response.
