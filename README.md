# 🌪️ Community Weather Risk Profiles – Calhoun County, Alabama

This project identifies and visualizes risk communication gaps for severe weather in Calhoun County, Alabama. It combines behavioral science, data science, and communication to highlight vulnerabilities in the ways in which weather warnings are received and acted upon, particularly in socially vulnerable or under-connected communities.

## Focus Area

**Calhoun County, Alabama**, a region with a history of tornadoes (some strong to violent), varying broadband access, and social vulnerability factors. This project seeks to answer:

- Who may be missing warnings?
- What barriers exist (language, internet, trust)?
- How can we visualize and communicate those gaps?

---

## Core Data Sources

- **CDC Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)**  
- **U.S. Census ACS** (language, internet access)  
- **NOAA/NWS API** (historical warnings & alerts)  
- **SPC/NCEI** (tornado paths, hazard events)

---

## Goals

- Build an interactive map or dashboard showing high-risk zones
- Overlay historical warning polygons with community demographics
- Create markdown reports that explain findings
- Highlight where public outreach or messaging adjustments are most needed

---

## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**, **Jupyter Notebook**, **Folium** or **Leaflet.js**
- **Pandas**, **GeoPandas**, **Plotly** (if Python)
- **Markdown** for narrative reports
- **VS Code** for development
- **GitHub Pages** (optional for publishing)

---

## Next Steps

1. Collect and preprocess SVI and ACS data for Calhoun County
2. Create base maps showing vulnerable areas
3. Overlay historical tornado warnings and hazard zones
4. Publish insights and visuals to GitHub and optionally social/blog
